# Milestone 2

## Description
This milestone was quite similar to the last one. We converted the previous milestone to utilize 
techniques regarding dynamic memory allocation.

## Challenges encountered
I ecnountered challenges in tracing my code and ensuring that my logic was correct-- this was due to
me not reading the instructions thorougly and also not paying attention to what I was doing. 

## Things I've learned
What is the most important thing you've learned from this milestone in the project?
I learned that utilizing dynamic memory allocation requires scrupulous attention to detail and that 
I should slow down before jumping into code.
